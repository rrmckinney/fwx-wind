# Wind Tunnel Build

To ensure the accuracy and consistency of the expendable wind sensors, they were tested in a wind tunnel along with a sonic anemometer. 

The wind tunnel build was adapted from [Harry Niedecken, 2021](https://www.buildagreenrv.com/building-a-wind-tunnel/#Force_Measurement).

The tunnel was constructed using four pieces of 2x2x8 ft plywood sheets faceted togteher with 16 metal brackets.

A flow straightener was constructed of corruagted plstaic sheets. To ensure good flow, the straightener cannot take up more than 10% of the area in the tunnel, therefore each of the sections were 3x3x15 inches.

A fan was then placed a foor behind the flow straightener. The sonic and davis wind sensors were placed on the other end.
