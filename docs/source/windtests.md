# Wind Tunnel Tests

As mentioned in the Wind Tunnel Build section, the expendable wind sensors were compared to a sonic anemometer. 

Through testing it was determined that there was a 1m/s difference in wind speed from the fan between the two sections of the tunnel. Therefore, the sonic was compared to the expendable wind senors when they were in the same spatial location rather than at the same time. 

Both the sonic and expendable wind senors were placed on either side of the tunnel for a 15min test in which the three different fan speeds were ran for 5mins. This allowed us to create two different multiple linear regression curves for each of the expendable wind sensors as compared to the sonic.
