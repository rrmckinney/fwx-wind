# Wind Tunnel Build

To ensure the accuracy and consistency of the expendable wind sensors, they were tested in a wind tunnel along with a [3D sonic anemometer](https://gillinstruments.com/compare-3-axis-anemometers/windmaster-3axis/). 

The wind tunnel build was adapted from [Harry Niedecken, 2021](https://www.buildagreenrv.com/building-a-wind-tunnel/#Force_Measurement).

The tunnel was constructed using four pieces of 2x2x8 ft plywood sheets faceted togteher with 16 metal brackets.

A flow straightener was constructed of corruagted plastic sheets. To ensure good flow, the straightener must [(Hruz et al.,2020)](https://doi.org/10.26552/aer.C.2020.2.1):
- take up less tha 10% of the cross sectional area
- have a length of at least 5x that of each section's diameter

Thus, each of the sections were 3x3x15 inches.

A fan was then placed flush within the end of the wind tunnel behind the flow straightener. Any holes alond the edges of the tunnel were sealed. 

The sonic and davis wind sensors were mounted on the other end ensuring directional placement was consitent.
