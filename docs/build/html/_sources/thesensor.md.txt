# The Expendable Wind Sensor

"""The expendable wind sensors were adapted from http://cactus.io/hookups/weather/anemometer/davis/hookup-arduino-to-davis-anemometer "

"""The wind sensors were designed to be placed within the path of prescribed wildfire path in order to capture flow dynamics within a wildfire. Thus, the wind sensors were built as cost effective as possible without minimizing accuracy."""

"""The wind sensors are composed of:
    - Davis cup anemometer
    - Arduino UNO board 
    - Arduino UNO SD card board extension
